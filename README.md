# 👋 Hi there 




### About Me 
🎩 I am James Thanni, a Software Engineer based in London who has recently graduated from Loughborough University with a BSc in Computer Science!

💻 I enjoy working on personal projects and I am passionate about building meaningful projects. I hope to work on a few projects using web frameworks such as Angular, NextJS and C# frameworks such as WPF. 

🧠 I’m currently learning Angular, C# and MongoDB! I am experienced with the LAMP stack, HTML, CSS, SASS, JS, SQL, MySQL and Python.

⌚ Outside of work my main hobbies lie in fitness and tech, where I constantly push myself to be on top of the latest developments in the tech world and to lead a healthy life by taking care of myself!

☁ To further my knowledge, I utilise platforms such as LinkedIn learning, PluralSight and YouTube tutorials from amazing creators such as Traversy Media and Derek Banas. I hope to begin reading more and to delve into the world personal development as well as investing through books and online courses soon.
