# üëã Hi there

üíª I enjoy working on personal projects and I am passionate about building meaningful projects. I hope to work on a few projects using web frameworks such as Angular, NextJS and C# frameworks such as WPF. 

üß† I‚Äôm currently learning Angular, C# and MongoDB! I am experienced with the LAMP stack, HTML, CSS, SASS, JS, SQL, MySQL and Python.
